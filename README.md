There are some notes of what i am doing or reading、what i have done or read，i like to write them down, i think this is a good way for me to learn and share.



You can clone this repository to get the note file（wrote by makedown），or you can visit this page https://rabbitnoteeth.github.io/liuxindong.giuhub.io/ to read them online. 



All of files are written by chinese, if you have any question or idea, welcome to leave me a message :smiley:.
